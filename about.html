    <h1>Why it Matters</h1>
    <div>
        <p>For generations, Italian Americans have helped shape the story of Washington State — from the family-run markets and fishing boats of the early 1900s, to the restaurants, builders, and artists who continue to enrich our communities today.</p>
        <p>But as Columbus Day faded from public calendars, many Italian Americans felt torn. We understood why that change was necessary. History must be told honestly, yet we also lost the one day that recognized our families' contributions and heritage.</p>
        <p>Italian People's Day offers a new path forward.</p>
        <p>It celebrates our ancestors' courage, creativity, and community spirit without the controversy of the past. It honors the people, not the politics — the real lives and stories that built our neighborhoods, one brick at a time.</p>
        <p>This day is about more than pride. It's about visibility, gratitude, and belonging.
            When we celebrate Italian People's Day, we affirm that cultural heritage matters — and that honoring one group does not erase another. Washington has made beautiful progress in celebrating its diverse communities. Now, we simply ask for a place in that circle.</p>
        <p>Together, let's create a day that all Italian Americans in Washington can share with their families, neighbors, and friends — a day of food, music, memory, and unity.</p>
